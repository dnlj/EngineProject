		//       structure that later gets removed by a higher priority small structure.

		// TODO: Theoretically a structure could overlap into unloaded/unfinished chunks.
		//       Don't we need to check and then generate those chunks here? Post culling.
		//       Or add some extra buffer to the initial request based on the largest known structure. <-- Easiest, but worse perf.
		//       
		//       Maybe at this point we could issue additional generation requests to generate
		//       those needed chunks. This is probably be the best option, but we need to add a
		//       way to generate those structs up to hte block stage and then not to structs.
		//       Right now we already store the stage so we just need to add a stage for structs
