// TODO: Add an example biome with this documentation.
/**
 * Adding structures to a biome.
 * - Create two OnDemandLayer based layers. MyBiomeStructureInfo and MyBiomeStructure.
 * - The structure info layer populates the structure description. This includes the structure
 *   bounding box and an id that identifies each structure. These are populated by assigning to the
 *   @p inserter argument.
 * - The Generator resolves any conflicts, invalid structures, overlaps, etc. from any relevant
 *   biomes and forwards the remaining structure descriptions to the structure layer for generation.
 * - The structure layer is called once for each relevant structure and can access the Terrain to
 *   modify chunk/block data and insert any ChunkEntities if needed.

// TODO: It might be better to look into some kind of trait/tag based system
//       for landmark generation instead of having it baked in at the biome
//       level. That would allow us to say something like:
//           Boss portals for LavaGuy can spawn anywhere with a temperature > 100deg or with the tag HasLavaGuy.
//       With genLandmarks that will need to be explicitly included in every
//       relevant biome. The tag/trait based system would also be useful for generating temporary
//       entities such as mobs.
